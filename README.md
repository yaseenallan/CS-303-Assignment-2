HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS

The program demonstrates the use of two data structures: a single linked list and a stack. The Single Linked List class uses a Node struct to store data and a pointer to the next node, with methods to add, remove, and retrieve items from the front and back of the list, insert or remove elements at specific indices, find the position of an item, and check if the list is empty. The constructor initializes an empty list, and the destructor deletes all nodes to free memory. The Integer Stack class uses a std::vector<int> to manage stack elements, with methods to push and pop elements, check if the stack is empty, retrieve the top element, calculate the average of elements, and return the stack size. The main program demonstrates these data structures by creating a linked list and stack, performing various operations like adding, removing, and retrieving elements, and calculating the average of the stack. The program showcases basic stack and linked list operations, such as insertion, removal, and retrieval.
